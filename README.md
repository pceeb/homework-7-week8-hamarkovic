This is what I got done this week. As you can see, it's pretty long so I didn't completely get the math done but it's almost done. I have all the values I need for the formula, I just need to implement the formula, which should not be much more work, but I don't have time to get it done before discussion.

## Homework7 Week8

You must submit a new version of the program in this **repostiroy**. 
It should be more functional than the version submitted week 7.
This is due before next discussion section.

**Important:** You must include some input, so Daniel can run your script.
